/**
 * Library for simple runtime injection of string and binary resources.
 * <h2>Notes</h2>
 * Examination of the usage of
 * {@link java.util.spi.ResourceBundleProvider ResourceBundleProviders}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>This would require a call of
 * {@link Module#addUses(Class) libraryModule.addUses(spiClass)}
 * at runtime and loading the string resource on behalf of the library module.
 * </li>
 * <li>â†’ This distinction of cases would suggest a
 * <code>@ResourcesProvider (modulename<sub>opt</sub>, basename)</code>
 * as opposed to
 * <code>@StringResources (modulename<sub>opt</sub>, packagename, basename)</code>.
 * </li>
 * <li>Build process requirement: the annotation processing would need to use the
 * already precompiled service provider module.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
